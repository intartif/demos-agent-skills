This folder contains one **Agent Skill** plus corporate wrappers for governance.

## Files
- `SKILL.md`: Open Agent Skills format (portable, runtime-consumable).
- `skill.yaml`: Corporate wrapper used by the L2 Control Plane (intent, risk, providers, tools).
- `policy.yaml`: Corporate policy rules (allow/deny/require) applied during execution.
- `references/`: Org-specific standards, checklists, and examples.
- `scripts/`: Optional helper scripts (only used where runtimes allow execution).

## Responsibility
Maintain the canonical definition of this capability and keep it aligned with enterprise governance.
